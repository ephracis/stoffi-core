/**
 * Keys.cs
 * 
 * This file lists all the keys and secrets used for access to
 * various API services.
 * 
 * You need to copy the file Keys.cs.tmpl to Keys.cs and fill it
 * with your own keys and secrets obtained from the services'
 * websites.
 * 
 * For a complete list of the links to all websites visit:
 * http://dev.stoffiplayer.com/wiki/Hacking
 * 
 * IMPORTANT:
 * Make sure you never upload your secret keys to any public
 * repository (include the offical Stoffi repo). If you do
 * you should consider your keys to be compromised and anyone
 * can impersonate your application and developer account at
 * the API service.
