/**
 * Sources.cs
 * 
 * Manages all sources from which music can be played.
 * This includes both local files and streams from Internet.
 * 
 * Right now the sources are hardcoded into the manager which
 * exposes the various source objects.
 * 
 * In the future we will move to a plugin based source system
 * where a special type of plugin will be able to provide
 * a source with methods for searching and playing the tracks
 * as well as fetching meta data.
